Notes:
need to remove 087 from line 120 in gp_prep_flists.sh
sox is being taken from usr/bin/sox each time in the path directory, not seeing it in the path list. 
Have commented out the checking in run.sh, not major but could do with a fix

For gp_data_prep.sh:
Commented out normalisation (lines 83-93)
Commented out use of train (line 98)
Commented out the text file (line 103)

In run.sh:
Commented out gp_data_prep.sh and gp_dict_prep.sh (lines 54-55) as both have run already (don't want to rerun every time)
