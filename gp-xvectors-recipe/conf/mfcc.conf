##### Config from lre07 recipe. High-resolution MFCCs used for DNN training.
# Note: we keep all cepstra, so it has the same info as filterbank features,
# but MFCC is more easily compressible (because less correlated) which is why
# we prefer this method.
--use-energy=false   # use average of log energy, not energy.
--sample-frequency=8000 #  Switchboard is sampled at 8kHz
--num-mel-bins=40     # similar to Google's setup.
--num-ceps=40     # there is no dimensionality reduction.
--low-freq=40    # low cutoff frequency for mel bins
--high-freq=-200 # high cutoff frequently, relative to Nyquist of 4000 (=3800)
--snip-edges=false

##### Config from lre07 recipe -- standard MFCCs used for... what?
--sample-frequency=8000 
--frame-length=25 # the default is 25
--low-freq=20 # the default.
--high-freq=3700 # the default is zero meaning use the Nyquist (4k in this case).
--num-ceps=20 # higher than the default which is 12.
--snip-edges=false



##### Config from original GP recipe
--use-energy=false # only non-default option.


##### Options we should go with (decisions to be made about all the abovementioned options)
--frame-length=25 # just the default, but confirmed by the X-vector LID paper
--num-ceps=23 # X-vector LID paper mentions 23, but does it include energy as well? Check!
--low-freq=20 # the default, probably reasonable?
--high-freq=3700 # This really needs to be checked because GP data is wide-band, unlike the SRE corpora
