--frame-length=25 			# Default. Confirmed by the X-vector LID paper.
--num-ceps=23 				# X-vector LID paper mentions 23; including energy or not? Check!
--low-freq=20 				# Default. Probably reasonable (see http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/feat.html)
--high-freq=7800 			# Inspired by the example at http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/feat.html
--sample-frequency=16000 	# GP is sampled at 16kHz.
--use-energy=false 			# Should be checked, but the X-vector LID paper doesn't mention energy.
--num-mel-bins=23 			# Default. Mentioned as "common for 16khz-sampled data" in feature-mfcc.h
--snip-edges=false 			# Just a reasonable thing to do, encouraged even by Kaldi authors.



# TO-DO check these defaults:

# hamming: window(i) = 0.54 - 0.46*cos(a * i_fl)
# povey: window(i) = pow(0.5 - 0.5*cos(a * i_fl), 0.85) (like hamming but goes to zero at edges)
# --window-type=povey

# --preemphasis-coefficient=0.97
# --vtln-*
